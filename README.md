# fake-news-detection-COVID19
A Spark-based fake news detection project using machine learning pipelines, logistic regression, and Gradio for a user-friendly interface.

The project focuses on detecting fake news related to COVID-19 using PySpark's MLlib framework. The solution leverages a pipeline of text preprocessing techniques—tokenization, stop-word removal, and feature extraction using CountVectorizer—followed by classification with Logistic Regression. The system predicts whether news is "Real" or "Fake" based on labeled training data. The methodology also integrates a user-friendly interface powered by Gradio for real-time predictions. The model achieves high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring reliable performance in identifying misinformation.
